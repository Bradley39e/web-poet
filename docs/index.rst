======================

web-poet implements Page Object pattern for web scraping.

The goal of this project is to make reusable Page Objects that separates
extraction logic from crawling. They could be easily tested and distributed
across different projects. Also, they could make use of different backends,
for example, acquiring data from `Splash`_ and `AutoExtract`_ API.

Please, see also our Installation guide and our Tutorial for a quick start.
